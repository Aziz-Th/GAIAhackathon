# GAIAhackathon 

# Summarizer -a project by LEVEL 8

this project takes advantage of powerful generative AI models such as ..... to help us, make long content(podcasts, interviews) more accessable, and give the listeners a brief description before they spend 2.5-3.0 hours on content.

for security issues and because we are using fast solutions like streamlit, please provide your OpenAI API key, to try the application.

NOTE: THIS IS A PROTOTYPE AND FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES ONLY, AND WE WON'T ASK FOR AN API KEY IN THE FINAL PRODUCT!!
